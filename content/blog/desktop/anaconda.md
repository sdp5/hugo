[Anaconda](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda) is the default installer choice of linux distros like [fedora](https://getfedora.org/), [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and others. It allows the user to set languages, keyboards, time & date, storage, networking, software packages and accounts. During installation, the target computerâ€™s hardware is identified, configured and appropriate file systems are created.

Users can select keyboard layouts for their language (and script) using the Keyboard tab. They can choose from a menu of options. Locating desired layout in this long list could seem tedious. Moreover, it can be hard to search for the US layout when using the wrong default layout.

An attempt was made to determine major keyboard layouts and place them first in the keyboard layouts selection list. Hence lesser scroll for the users.

[anaconda-34.5-1](https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/commit/429b4c1eec2b8d00654c7141bfb3fd580729f76e) gracefully includes this proposal, making a significant improvement when selecting keyboards.

happy hacking!
