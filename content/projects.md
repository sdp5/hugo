## Transtats

The [project](https://transtats.org/) helps developers to ship RHEL/fedora packages with translation completeness,
managers to automate localization workflow and oversee the localization effort progress by
product releases as well as language maintainers to estimate translation volume.

> Reduced translation delivery time by 20%, saving Red Hat localisation teams
hundreds of hours annually and improving progress visibility for the language community.

Stack: `Python`, `Django`, `REST`, `Celery`, `PostgreSQL`, `PatternFLY`, `JQuery`
